As mentioned above, there are a variety of wheels for TT motors. But there are a variety of wheels for other motors as well. Make sure the wheel is intended for a TT motor. Forcing other wheels not intended for a TT motor can damage the axel and the wheel. Make sure the wheel has the proper opening for the axel.
