# Notes for Teacher 

***In Progress***

## Overview

In this lesson, students will design a chassis for the rover and determine the placement of the motor driver board, the ball castor wheel, and the battery pack.

## General Notes

1. **Preparation**: Ensure all materials, especially the datasheets for the components, 3D printer, filament, and Tinkercad software, are available and ready for use. Check the 3D printer for any maintenance needs. 
2. **Introduction**: Explain the importance of planning where components are placed, which can affect the design of the chassis. Some of the rovers will topple during testing. Careful consideration of the weight distribution of the components will be an essential aspect of the design process. The walls of the chassis and surface should be 3mm.
3. **Guidance**: During the design process, guide the students in considering the bolt specifications in their designs. Encourage them to consider why specific hole diameters might work better than others. 
4. **Safety**: Ensure all students follow safety guidelines while using the 3D printer. It might be beneficial to do a safety refresher before starting the assignment. 
5. **Assessment**: Use the provided rubric to assess each student's work. Remember to give constructive feedback to help them improve. 
6. **Differentiation**: Be prepared to support students struggling with the assignment. This could include providing templates, one-on-one assistance, or additional resources. 
7. **Reflection**: After the assignment, have a class discussion about the results. Which hole diameters worked best? Why? What would they do differently next time? 

## TT Motor Wheels

There are a variety of different wheels available for TT motors. These wheels differ in diameter and the type of tread for different types of surfaces, as displayed below:

Students can 3D print wheels, such as the gray wheel, with an o-ring. The dimensions of the drive shaft are given on some datasheets.

As mentioned above, there are a variety of wheels for TT motors. But there are a variety of wheels for other motors as well. Make sure the wheel is intended for a TT motor. Forcing other wheels not intended for a TT motor can damage the drive shaft and the wheel. Make sure the wheel has the proper opening for the drive shaft.

## Sourcing Materials

TT motor wheels are often difficult to find. Many times a search from a vendor will return results for other wheels that are not compatible

## Follow-Up Lessons or Extensions

The two examples below can be used as follow-up lessons or extensions to the lesson. It may be the case that the students' designs may require one of these modifications.

### Designing a Wheel

The measurements of the drive shaft are on the following datasheet.

Using the measurements above, students can design 3D-printed wheels with o-rings for the TT motors.
