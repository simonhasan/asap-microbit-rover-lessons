# Differentiation
**For Visual Learners**: Use visual aids such as diagrams and videos to explain the process of designing and testing the pieces. Encourage these students to use color coding in their engineering design notebooks.

**For Auditory Learners**: Explain the steps verbally and encourage discussion. Allow these students to discuss their ideas and processes with a partner or the class.

**For Kinesthetic Learners**: Provide these students with extra materials to manipulate while they are designing their test pieces physically. Encourage them to build prototypes with modeling clay before finalizing their design.

**For Advanced Learners**: Challenge these students to test more than the minimum number of diameters. Encourage them to explore different types of bolts or designs for the test pieces. These students can also explore designing recessed holes or holes for different bolts, such as flathead countersunk bolts.

**For Learners Needing Extra Suppor**t: Provide these students with templates or guides for their design notebooks. Consider pairing them with a partner for support during the design and testing process.

**For English Language Learner**s: Provide vocabulary lists and ensure instructions are clear and understandable. Consider pairing them with bilingual students who can help explain the tasks.
