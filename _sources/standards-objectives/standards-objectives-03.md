## Objectives

> - **Analyze and Synthesize Data**: Students will be able to analyze and synthesize data from different sources, such as the datasheet for the ELECFREAKS Motor:bit, the measurements of the castor ball wheel, the battery pack, and the 3D printed motor bracket with the TT motor. They will then use this data to design a chassis for the rover that can accommodate all the components and meet the criteria and constraints of the problem.
> - **Design and Model**: Students will be able to use paper, ruler, scissors, and glue to create a physical model of the rover chassis and its components. They will also use Tinkercad to create a 3D model of the rover chassis and its components. They will apply their understanding of the dimensions, features, and functions of the components to create and modify their models.
> - **Implement and Test**: Students will be able to implement their design by printing their 3D model using a 3D printer. They will follow the safety and operational guidelines of the 3D printer and check for any errors or defects. They will then test their 3D-printed rover chassis and its components by assembling them and checking for the fit, stability, and functionality of the rover.
> - **Evaluate and Refine**: Students will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of their design through testing and feedback. They will identify the strengths and weaknesses of their design and make necessary modifications to improve their design. They will document the progress and changes in their engineering design notebooks, reflecting on their design process and learning.
> - **Communicate and Justify**: Students will be able to communicate their design process and justify their design choices in their engineering design notebooks. They will explain the reasoning behind their design decisions and how their design meets the criteria and constraints of the problem. They will also present their design process and choices to the class and solicit feedback from their peers.
