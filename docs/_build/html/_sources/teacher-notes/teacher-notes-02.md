# Notes for Teacher

## Overview

In this lesson, students will design a bracket to mount a TT motor with 2 M3x30 bolts. This bracket will be integrated into the chassis in the next lesson.

## General Notes

1. **Preparation**: Ensure all materials, especially the datasheets for the components, 3D printer, filament, and Tinkercad software, are available and ready for use. Check the 3D printer for any maintenance needs. 
2. **Introduction**: Explain the importance of planning where components are placed, which can affect the design of the chassis. Some of the rovers will topple during testing. Careful consideration of the weight distribution of the components will be an essential aspect of the design process. The walls of the test bracket should be 3mm. A bracket will be functional if it only secures the two holes near the center of the motor. If students intend to enclose the entire motor, they must account for protrusions in the design. These dimensions of the protrusions are on one datasheet.
3. **Guidance**: During the design process, guide the students in considering the measurements on the datasheet and the measurements they recorded. Mention that the bracket should not be too tight, as it will constrict the gears inside the motor. The bracket should not be too loose, as it will cause the motor to move around. The motor should slide in and out of the bracket easily. 
4. **Safety**: Ensure all students follow safety guidelines while using the 3D printer. It might be beneficial to do a safety refresher before starting the assignment. 
5. **Assessment**: Use the provided rubric to assess each student's work. Remember to give constructive feedback to help them improve. 
6. **Differentiation**: Be prepared to support students struggling with the assignment. This could include providing templates, one-on-one assistance, or additional resources. 
7. **Reflection**: After the assignment, have a class discussion about the results. Which hole diameters worked best? Why? What would they do differently next time? 

## Sourcing Materials

TT motors are available with or without wheels on Amazon and eBay. They often do not have some specifications, such as the supply voltage range or gear ratio. Many gear motors often do not come with wires and may require soldering. Others may come with wires but without an adequate connector for the terminal blocks.
