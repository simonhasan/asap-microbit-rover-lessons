# Differentiation

**For Visual Learners**: Use visual aids such as diagrams and videos to explain the process of designing and testing the chassis. Encourage these students to use color-coding in their engineering design notebooks.

**For Auditory Learners**: Explain the steps verbally and encourage discussion. Allow these students to discuss their ideas and processes with a partner or the class.

**For Kinesthetic Learners**: Provide these students with extra materials to manipulate while they are physically designing their chassis. Encourage them to build prototypes or models before finalizing their design.

**For Advanced Learners**: Challenge these students to design a chassis to accommodate additional components. Encourage them to explore different materials or designs for the chassis.

**For Learners Needing Extra Support**: Provide these students with templates or guides for their design notebooks. Consider pairing them with a partner for support during the design and testing process.

**For English Language Learners**: Provide vocabulary lists and ensure instructions are clear and understandable. Consider pairing them with bilingual students who can help explain the tasks.
