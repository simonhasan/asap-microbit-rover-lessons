| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Analyze and Evaluate**: Students will analyze the specifications of the M3 bolt using calipers and a datasheet and evaluate the necessary diameters for the test piece holes. | **Arizona Educational Technology Standards**<br />**9-12.4.a:** Students know and use a deliberate design process for generating ideas, testing theories, creating innovative artifacts or solving authentic problems.<br /><br />**Arizona Engineering Standards**<br />**2.8**: Document and report all results<br />**5.2**: Use measurement devices such as calipers, oscilloscopes, and digital multimeters to gather data for analysis |
| **Design and Create**: Students will design a test piece with a minimum of 4 different diameters for the M3 bolt, ensuring the maximum height does not exceed 3mm and the area around the holes is minimized to save filament and reduce printing time. | **Arizona Educational Technology Standards**<br />**9-12.4.a:** Students know and use a deliberate design process for generating ideas, testing theories, creating innovative artifacts or solving authentic problems.<br />**9-12.4.b**: Students select and use digital tools to plan and manage a design process that considers design constraints and calculated risks.<br />**9-12.4.c:** Students develop, test and refine prototypes as part of a cyclical design process.<br /><br />**Arizona Engineering Standards**<br />**2.4**: Select the best solution within the constraints and criteria.<br />**2.5**: Develop a prototype or model to test the selected solution.<br />**2.7**: Evaluate the solution, and revise or repeat if necessary.<br />**2.8**: Document and report all results<br />**3.3**: Display data graphically using diagrams and working drawings.<br />**5.4**: Use software tools to solve, model, analyze, and/or design solutions to engineering problems. |
| **Apply and Test**: Students will apply their design skills to create a 3D model of the test piece in Tinkercad, ensuring it matches the specifications of their diagram. They will then 3D print the test piece and test the fit of the M3 bolt in each hole. | **Arizona Educational Technology Standards**<br />**9-12.4.a:** Students know and use a deliberate design process for generating ideas, testing theories, creating innovative artifacts or solving authentic problems.<br />**9-12.4.c:** Students develop, test and refine prototypes as part of a cyclical design process.<br /><br />**Arizona Engineering Standards**<br />**2.5**: Develop a prototype or model to test the selected solution.<br />**5.5**: Identify hazards, risks, and incidents related to tools and equipment.<br />**5.6**: Practice safe use of tools, machines, equipment, and materials. |
| **Reflect and Revise**: If necessary, students will revise their design based on the results of their tests, documenting the entire process in their engineering design notebook. They will reflect on their design process and the outcomes, identifying areas of success and areas for improvement. | **Arizona Educational Technology Standards**<br />**9-12.4.a:** Students know and use a deliberate design process for generating ideas, testing theories, creating innovative artifacts or solving authentic problems.<br />**9-12.4.c:** Students develop, test and refine prototypes as part of a cyclical design process.<br /><br />**Arizona Engineering Standards**<br />**2.1**: Identify the problem.<br />**2.3**: Explore possible issues or options to the problem.<br/>**2.4**: Select the best solution within the constraints and criteria.<br />**2.6**: Implement the solution.<br/>**2.7**: Evaluate the solution, and revise or repeat if necessary (i.e., Are there other solutions, better solutions, or cheaper solutions?<br/>etc.)<br/>**2.8**: Document and report all results. |
