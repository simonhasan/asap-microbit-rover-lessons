| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Analyze and Evaluate**: Students will analyze the specifications of the M3 bolt using calipers and a datasheet and evaluate the necessary diameters for the test piece holes. | **NGSS Standards**<br />**HS-ETS1-3**: Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account for a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics, as well as possible social, cultural, and environmental impacts. |
| **Design and Create**: Students will design a test piece with a minimum of 4 different diameters for the M3 bolt, ensuring the maximum height does not exceed 3mm and the area around the holes is minimized to save filament and reduce printing time. | **HS-ETS1-2**: Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved through engineering. |
| **Apply and Test**: Students will apply their design skills to create a 3D model of the test piece in Tinkercad, ensuring it matches the specifications of their diagram. They will then 3D print the test piece and test the fit of the M3 bolt in each hole. | **HS-ETS1-4**: Use a computer simulation to model the impact of proposed solutions to a complex real-world problem with numerous criteria and constraints on interactions within and between systems relevant to the problem. |
| **Reflect and Revise**: If necessary, students will revise their design based on the results of their tests, documenting the entire process in their engineering design notebook. They will reflect on their design process and the outcomes, identifying areas of success and areas for improvement. | **Arizona Educational Technology Standards**<br /><br />NGSS Standards<br />**HS-ETS1-1**: Analyze a major global challenge to specify qualitative and quantitative criteria and constraints for solutions that account for societal needs and wants. |
| **Synthesize and Extend**: Students will synthesize their learning by creating a functioning bracket based on their test piece and extend their learning by considering how their design could be applied in real-world engineering contexts. | HS-ETS1-5(MA): Plan a prototype or design solution using orthographic projections and isometric drawings, using proper scales and proportions |
