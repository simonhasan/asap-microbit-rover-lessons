# Differentiation

**For Visual Learners**: Use visual aids such as diagrams and videos to explain the process of designing and testing the motor bracket. Encourage these students to use color coding in their engineering design notebooks.

**For Auditory Learners**: Explain the steps verbally and encourage discussion. Allow these students to discuss their ideas and processes with a partner or the class.

**For Kinesthetic Learners**: Provide these students with extra materials to manipulate while they are designing their motor brackets physically. Encourage them to build prototypes with modeling clay before finalizing their design.

**For Advanced Learners**: Challenge these students to design a bracket that can fasten to all three holes on the motor. Encourage them to explore different protrusions on the motor and design the motor bracket to fit the protrusions.

**For Learners Needing Extra Support**: Provide these students with templates or guides for their design notebooks. Consider pairing them with a partner for support during the design and testing process.

**For English Language Learners**: Provide vocabulary lists and ensure clear and understandable instructions. Consider pairing them with bilingual students who can help explain the tasks.
